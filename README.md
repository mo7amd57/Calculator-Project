# Calculator-Project
Calculator Project developed by C language on AVR microcontroller

ðŸ“¢ Exciting News! I just completed a fascinating project using the C language and the Atmega32 AVR microcontroller. ðŸš€

I built a fully functional calculator with an array of impressive features that I can't wait to share with you! Here's a sneak peek into what my project can do:

âœ… Multi-operation support: My calculator can handle more than 10 different operations. Whether it's addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or beyond, I've got you covered!

âœ… Precedence management: I've implemented a robust algorithm to handle the precedence of multiplication and division operations. This ensures that the calculator performs calculations accurately, following the proper order of operations.

âœ… Backspace functionality: I've incorporated a convenient backspace feature that allows you to easily correct any mistakes while entering numbers or operators. It's all about making your calculations seamless and user-friendly!

Building this calculator was an incredible learning experience for me. It challenged my programming skills and gave me hands-on experience with microcontrollers. I'm proud of the final result and can't wait to tackle more exciting projects in the future.
